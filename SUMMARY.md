**NPU-BOLT: A Dataset for Bolt Object Detection in Natural Scene Images** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the construction industry, and in the engineering domain. 

The dataset consists of 337 images with 1275 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including *bolt nut*, *bolt head*, *blur bolt*, and other: *bolt side*.

Images in the NPU-BOLT dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 3 image-sets: <span style="background-color: #ecdefc; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px;">3D CAD simulation</span> (17 images), <span style="background-color: #ecdefc; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px;">captured by authors</span> (204 images), and <span style="background-color: #ecdefc; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 4px;">from internet</span> (116 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the Northwestern Polytechnical University, China.
