**NPU-BOLT: A Dataset for Bolt Object Detection in Natural Scene Images** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the construction industry. 

The dataset consists of 337 images with 1275 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including *bolt_b*, *bolt_a*, *vague*, and other: *bolt_c*.

Images in the NPU-BOLT dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2022 by the [Northwestern Polytechnical University, China](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/).
