**NPU-BOLT: A Dataset for Bolt Object Detection in Natural Scene Images** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the construction industry, and in the engineering domain. 

The dataset consists of 337 images with 1275 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including *bolt nut*, *bolt head*, *blur bolt*, and other: *bolt side*. There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 3 image-sets: ***captured by authors*** (204 images), ***from internet*** (116 images), and ***3D CAD simulation*** (17 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the Northwestern Polytechnical University, China.
